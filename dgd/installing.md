title: Installing DGD

First, you'll need the code to DGD. You can check out the latest version like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/dworkin/dgd.git
```

Now, change into DGD's src directory and build it:

```
cd dgd/src
make install
```

This will build DGD (if all goes well) and copy it into the "bin" subdirectory of the repository you just cloned.

## Dependencies

In order to build DGD successfully, as shown above, you may need to install some tools.

(TBD)
