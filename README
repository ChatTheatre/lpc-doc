This will eventually become the LPC documentation repository.

Everything in the repository can be shown on the web.  For instance, this file
is available as:

    http://lpc-doc.sourceforge.net/repository.php/README

As long as HTML documents use relative paths, links will work both in your
own repository and on SourceForge.
